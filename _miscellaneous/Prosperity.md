## Overview
*Prosperity* is a 15-day trading challenge hosted by IMC Trading, a trading firm. The 15-day challenge is separated into 5 rounds, each of which lasts 72 hours. Within each round, teams compete in a pair of challenges -- an *algorithmic* challenge, which involves noticing trends in markets and writing Python code to automate buying and selling of certain commodities, and a *manual* challenge, which involves submitting a single answer to a trading-based question. I focused on solving the manual challenges. My thought process and the outcomes are detailed below.

# Round 1
In round 1, we were given the following table of currencies to trade, along with their corresponding exchange rates:

|                 |  Snowballs  |  Pizza  |  Silicon Nuggets  |  Seashells  |
|-----------------|-------------|---------|-------------------|-------------|
|    Snowballs    |   1.00      |  1.45   |        0.52       |    0.72     |
|      Pizza      |    0.70     |   1.00  |        0.31       |     0.48    |
| Silicon Nuggets |   1.95      |  3.10   |     1.00          |   1.49      |
| Seashells       |   1.34      | 1.98    |        0.64       |    1.00     |

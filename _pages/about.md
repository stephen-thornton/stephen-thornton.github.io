## Below the upper critical dimension of a disordered rigidity transition
Collaborators: Danilo Liarte, Itai Cohen, Jim Sethna

We extend the analysis of a type of effective medium theory that makes predictions for the dynamical response of elastic networks that are randomly diluted. Mean-field theories tend to describe critical exponents and universal scaling functions for physical quantities close to transitions well above the upper critical dimension. The CPA does even better: similar to mode-coupling theories, it predicts the existence of an upper critical dimension in dynamical quantities in two dimensions, which is widely believed to be accurate for the jamming transition. We investigate the logarithmic corrections to scaling present in the upper critical dimension, and give explicit formulas for universal scaling functions of viscoelastic moduli above, in, and below the upper critical dimension. We find that the scaling variable that induces the instability of the mean-field fixed point constitutes a nonperturbative effect in infinite-dimensional models.

## Topological defects in exotic nematic phases of bent-core liquid crystals
Collaborators: Leo Radzihovsky

We examine the topological defects predicted by homotopy theory in the nematic phases formed of bent-core molecules. Due to the experimental detection of phases that spontaneously break chiral symmetry, it is known that a Landau-free-energy description of all nematic phases requires tensors of up to three indices. The most general forms of these free energy functions then unsurprisingly allow for phases with a wide variety of symmetries. Most notably, a tetrahedratic phase with a tetrahedral symmetry group is allowed; this phase cannot be distinguished from an isotropic phase by a linear optical experiment. We classify the topological defects in all of these predicted phases, draw sample molecular orientations around each type of defect, and clarify the braiding rules for defects within each phase. In the tetrahedratic phase, there are six topologically distinct defects. (To appear)

## Crossover scaling between rigidity percolation transitions with tunable anisotropy
Collaborators: William Wang, Bulbul Chakraborty, Anna Barth, Navneet Singh, Japheth Omonira, Jonathan Michel, Moumita Das, Jim Sethna, Itai Cohen

We perform a detailed numerical investigation of the critical phenomena present within a bond-diluted triangular lattice in which bonds are preferentially removed in a particular direction, inducing a long-wavelength anisotropy. Anticipating different scaling for each of the statistically independent long-wavelength elastic moduli, we measure each component of the elastic tensor by performing several distinct shears. We find an isotropic rigidity percolation transition that, upon increasing anisotropy, splits into multiple rigidity transitions for each component of the elastic tensor. There is an intermediate phase where the lattice has linear elasticity in only one shear direction. We quantify the new critical exponents associated with the pair of transitions, and perform a crossover scaling analysis to find the shapes of the crossover scaling functions for each independent elastic modulus.

## Analogies between jamming transitions and collective dynamics of charges in strange metals
Collaborators: Danilo Liarte, Peter Abbamonte, Jim Sethna, Debanjan Chowdhury

We interpret the results of a momentum-resolved electron energy-loss spectroscopy (M-EELS) experiment on a high-temperature superconductor (BSCCO) in the strange metal phase. The inferred susceptibility from the scattering experiment shows no evidence of a plasmonic excitation (the norm in ordinary Fermi liquids) except at the longest wavelengths probed. This is often taken as evidence of an exotic spectrum of quantum-critical excitations that extends throughout the Brillouin Zone into which the plasmonic excitation can rapidly decay, analogously to the Landau damping caused by the particle-hole continuum in Fermi liquids. In classical jamming, there is a similar population of vibrational modes that extends down to the lowest frequencies in the proximity of the zero-temperature jamming point. We make use of the exactly solvable coherent potential approximation and its predictions for susceptibilities to draw a phenomenological correspondence between the unknown charged bosonic low-energy excitations in the strange metal and the large number of low-frequency modes present in the nearly-unjammed granular solid.

## Universal scaling theories for spatiotemporal response functions near jamming and rigidity percolation transitions
Collaborators: Danilo Liarte, Eric Schwen, Itai Cohen, Debanjan Chowdhury, Jim Sethna

Here we leverage an exactly-solvable model for a disordered rigidity transition with a multicritical point to extract functional forms for all linear response quantities: Green's functions, susceptibilities, viscosities, frequency-dependent viscoelastic moduli, etc. We cast these into scaling forms (with scaling variables that imply mean-field-like critical exponents and explicit functional forms of universal scaling functions) that are asymptotically valid in the vicinity of the critical point, and in doing so extract features of the transition that are expected to be universal.

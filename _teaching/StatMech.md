## Spring 2022, Spring 2023, Spring 2024
Head teaching assistant of the graduate Statistical Mechanics course, taught by Prof. Jim Sethna following his text Entropy, Order Parameters and Complexity (available [here](https://sethna.lassp.cornell.edu/StatMech/)). Covers emergent laws, different statistical mechanical ensembles, free energies, entropy, order parameters and topology, linear response theory, abrupt transitions, and continuous transitions with renormalization group techniques. Assisted students with problems (in flipped-classroom style), held office hours, and crafted numerous exam and homework problems in collaboration with Jim (a subset of the problems that are available [here](https://sethna.lassp.cornell.edu/StatMech/SethnaExercises.pdf)).

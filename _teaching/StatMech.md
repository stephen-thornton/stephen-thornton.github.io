## Spring 2022, Spring 2023, Spring 2024
Head teaching assistant of the graduate Statistical Mechanics course, taught by Prof. Jim Sethna following his text Entropy, Order Parameters and Complexity (available [here](https://sethna.lassp.cornell.edu/StatMech/)). Covers emergent laws, different statistical mechanical ensembles, free energies, entropy, order parameters and topology, linear response theory, abrupt transitions, and continuous transitions with renormalization group techniques. Assisted students with problems (in flipped-classroom style), held office hours, and crafted numerous exam and homework problems in collaboration with Jim (a subset of the problems that are available [here](https://sethna.lassp.cornell.edu/StatMech/SethnaExercises.pdf)).

# N1.7 Beer and rigidity: Jamming
We introduce constraint-counting arguments for the determination of rigidity. Students analyze a singular susceptibility and its scaling near a phase transition. This is related to the solid foam formed in the head of a (nicely poured) beer.

# N1.11 Entropy of Matermind<sup>TM</sup>
Inspired by 3Blue1Brown's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v68zYyaEmEA) on understanding good Wordle<sup>TM</sup> guesses using information theory, we develop an entropy-based strategy for the first guess of Mastermind<sup>TM</sup>. By allowing the codemaker and codebreaker to simultaneously adjust their (restricted) strategies, we find a nontrivial Nash equilibrium for the game.

# N1.17 Nonabelian defects
We guide students through an investigation of topological defects with non-abelian first homotopy groups. We introduce the consequent braiding statistics and path-dependence of transport properties with simple visuals.

# N1.21 Pendulum ergodicity
We guide students through concepts related to ergodicity in a Hamiltonian system. Students confirm that time averages are equal to appropriately weighted microcanonical averages on accessible ergodic components. The consequences of having an energy surface with two disconnected components are investigated in this context.

# N1.23 Averaging over disorder
We illustrate calculations of free energies of systems with quenched disorder in their Hamiltonian.

# N1.26 Correlation matching
Students examine snapshots of an Ising model, and match them with the appropriate features that appear in the correlation function.

# N1.27 Coarsening correlations
Students investigate the time-dependent non-equilibrium correlation function of Ising model coarsening after a quench from high temperature. Snapshots of Glauber dynamics and Kawasaki dynamics at different times are shown. For Glauber dynamics, the correlation function decays simply in space and appears self-similar in time with a characteristic exponent for non-conserved dynamics. For Kawasaki dynamics, the correlation function oscillates as it decays in space. Under conserved dynamics, regions need to "steal" spins from neighboring regions to grow, leading to enhanced anticorrelations.

# N1.28 Ising critical correlations
Students examine correlation functions near the Ising critical point. Using these, they estimate correlation lengths and critical exponents.

# N1.29 Rubber band dynamics I: Random walk
Students investigate a model of an entropic rubber band subject to a (repulsive) quadratic potential, with update rules similar to the Ising model (heat bath). Students write code to simulate the model, and investigate the behavior as a function of temperature. They numerically find a critical temperature below which the rubber band is pulled away from the origin.

# N1.30 Rubber band dynamics II: Diffusion
Students map their update rules from N1.29 to a diffusion equation. They investigate the behavior of the diffusion equation as a function of the temperature, and show there is a bifurcation in the dynamics at a particular value of the temperature. They compute the distributions of lengths at different temperatures.

# N1.31 Rubber band dynamics III: Free energy and statics
The model from N1.29 and N1.30 is revealed to be the Ising model with all-to-all couplings, with the length of the band corresponding to the net magnetization. The free energy in the ensemble of fixed force (external field) is used to study equilibrium properties and related to a Landau description. Gradient dynamics and their relationship to heat bath dynamics are investigated.
